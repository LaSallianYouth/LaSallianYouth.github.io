        <h1>Living Lassalian</h1>
        <p>Living LaSallian calls us to live a life in line with the LaSallian principles. 
            A life that is balanced in faith, community and service. There are many ways to do this. 
            One way is to come to LSY. LSY is on Fridays during Mindshift on the rugby stands. In addition to this, 
            you can serve the community around you and help assist different foundations. 
            There are some websites you can use for this below as well as information about LSY.
