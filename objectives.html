            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">Faith</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest issues that society faces is a lack of faith and belief in themselves, those around them or in something that seeks to make the world a better place. This causes many mental health issues and problems societal norms. That is why our first objective is faith. You can have faith in Christianity (the main basis of our values), have faith in another religion or in something not associated with religion at all. We advocate for confident and trusting relationships between people and within people, having faith in something good and that faith leading people to do things for the betterment of the world. In LSY, we just try to show the youth that it is important to have a belief in something good and that our world will be better off as long as you believe in the good thing and have faith in it.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">Service</h2>
            <p>In a world where everyone is looking out for themselves, the most vulnerable of society is often forgotten about. LSY tries to teach the youth that it is important to serve others and be a servant leader. Service is one of the three main objectives that LSY tries to get its youth to internalise. We have many programs running year-round that range from helping the less fortunate all the way to going to old-age homes.

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">Community</h2>
            <p>Creating a sense of community is one of our main missions. We want to create a community where people can openly share thoughts and ideas, where the youth are shown that they have gifts and talents and where the youth are shown how to fully utilise those gifts and talents for the betterment of everyone.
