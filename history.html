        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p style="margin-left: 25vw; margin-right: 25vw; font-size: 1.8em;">LaSallian Youth officially began in 1988. However, the main concept existed for far longer than that. The actual Lasallian charism principles come from Saint John Baptise De La Salle who lived in the mid-17th century. From his life, we derive many principles as well as our name.</p>

        <p class="delasalletext">Saint John Baptise De La Salle lived in the mid-17th century and was born into an aristocratic family. Being quite bright and well-grounded in his faith, he was named Canon of the Reims cathedral at age 16 where he pursued higher studies. Due to the passing of his parents, he was forced to return home and look after his family. During this ordeal, he arrived at the realisation that the majority of the children of the time had next to no opportunities to advance their social and economic status. De La Salle believed that education could provide the solution. With this belief in mind, he started using his family’s wealth to establish what is arguably the largest religious order dedicated to education in the world.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img class="delasallepic" src="assets/history2.jpg">
        <p class="delasalletext">Two of the many missions of the Lasallian charism is to help the youth in "getting to know themselves and to become socially at ease and to promote their creativity, their critical spirit and responsibility and to create among themselves a community atmosphere”. Due to this, many brothers and leaders of the order started implementing youth groups in Lasallian institutions. Around the 1980s, groups like this had sprung up in different institutions around the world. Leaders of these groups began to communicate with each other and started organising meet-ups between these groups. Once this started happening, they realised that they all had the same ideas. As the LaSallian network strengthened, so did LSY. In 1988 the term LaSallian Youth was coined which provided the official creation of LSY. At its core, LSY was to be a decentralized group of youth that works together to combat issues in the community while still being a platform where they can be themselves and make new friends of different ages, ethnicities and backgrounds.
