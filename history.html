        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>LaSallian Youth or LSY for short officially began in 1988. However the actual concept of it existed a long time before. 
            To see this we have to first look the history of Saint John Baptise De La Salle the founder of the LaSallian order.

        <p class="delasalletext">Saint John Baptise De La Salle lived in the late 17th century and was born into an aristocratic family. Being quite bright and well grounded in his faith, he was named canon of Reims cathedral at age 16 and pursued higher studies. Due to the passing of his parents he was forced to return home and look after his family. During this ordeal he made a realisation. Majority of children during this time had next to no possibilities to advance their social and economic status. De La Salle believed that education could provide the solution. So using his family’s wealth he began what is arguably the largest religious order dedicated to education in the world.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <img class="delasallepic" src="assets/history2.jpg">
        <p class="delasalletext">To aid De La Salle’s mission brothers around the world independently. Came up with the idea to form groups of students to “ get to know themselves and to become socially at ease”. These groups started to pop up around the world and in the 1980’s these different associations started communicating. These groups then started having meetings with other local groups. These groups where run by the youth. Once these groups started to meet up they formed the idea to have an international meetup. In 1985 the second international meetup occured and would continue to. In 1988 the term LaSallian Youth was coined. Which provided the official creation of LSY. A decentralized group of youth that work together to combat issues in the community around them
